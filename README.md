# Video to ASCII Converter in C++

## Project Description

This project is a command-line application developed in C++ that converts video frames into ASCII art in real-time. It leverages the OpenCV library for video processing to read frames from a video file, convert them to grayscale, resize them, and then map pixel brightness levels to a set of ASCII characters. The resulting ASCII art is displayed in the console window, creating a unique viewing experience of the video in a text-based format.

This approach demonstrates an interesting use case of digital image processing and character-based visualization, making it an excellent educational tool for understanding the basics of video frame manipulation and ASCII art generation.
